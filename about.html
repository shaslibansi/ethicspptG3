          <h2>Kant’s Moral Philosophy</h2>
          <h4>
            First published Mon Feb 23, 2004; substantive revision Thu Oct 2,
            2025
          </h4>
          <br />
          <p>
            <b>Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) </b><br />argued that the supreme
            principle of morality is a principle of rationality that he dubbed
            the “Categorical Imperative” (CI). In Kant’s view, the CI is an
            objective, rationally necessary and unconditional principle that all
            rational agents must follow despite any desires they may have to the
            contrary. He of course thought that we, though imperfect, are all
            rational agents. So he argued that all of our own specific moral
            requirements are justified by this principle. If he is right, that
            means that all immoral actions are irrational because they violate
            the CI. Other philosophers, such as Hobbes, Locke and Aquinas, also
            argued that moral requirements are requirements of rationality.
            However, these standards were either instrumental principles of
            rationality for satisfying one’s desires, as in Hobbes, or external
            rational principles that are discoverable by reason, as in Locke and
            Aquinas. Kant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis
            of practical reason reveals the requirement that rational agents
            must conform to instrumental principles. Yet he also argued that
            conformity to the CI (a non-instrumental principle of rationality),
            and so to moral requirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown
            to be essential to rational agency. This argument was based on his
            striking doctrine that a rational will must be regarded as
            autonomous, or free in the sense of being the author of the law that
            binds it. The fundamental principle of morality — the CI — is none
            other than the law of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of
            Kant’s moral philosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in
            practical affairs goes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the
            passions. Moreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason
            in each person that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for
            viewing each as possessed of equal worth and deserving of equal
            respect.
